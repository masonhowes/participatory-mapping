For a lot of students, the move to Seattle can be very difficult. You are away from home for the first time and in a new, urban environment. Even for those who have been in Seattle for a long time, there are many helpful resources available to those in need. Whether it's something like advising, school supplies, or even good study spots/places to eat, this map has it all! Check out all of the blue dots on the map to see what fellow students have deemed great, helpful resources!

If you would like to make your own contribution, click on the map where your resource is located at, and fill in the fields that pop up.
